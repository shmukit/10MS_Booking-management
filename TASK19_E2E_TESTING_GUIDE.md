   # Check if ports are available
   lsof -i :3001  # Backend port
   lsof -i :5173  # Frontend port
   
   # Kill processes if needed
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify database is running
   docker ps | grep postgres
   
   # Restart database if needed
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

3. **Test Data Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and reset test data
   cd backend
   npm run db:reset
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Authentication Failures**
   ```bash
   # Verify JWT secret is set
   echo $JWT_SECRET
   
   # Check user creation in test setup
   npm run test:setup
   ```

### Performance Considerations

- Tests create and clean up significant amounts of data
- Database operations may be slow on first run
- Network timeouts may occur with external services
- Consider using test database for isolation

### Security Notes

- Test data includes sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Ensure test databases are properly secured
- Clean up test data in production environments
- Use mock services for external integrations in testing
