## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

1. **Install Docker** (required for database)
2. **Start database**: `docker compose up -d`
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Setup database**: 
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma db push
   npm run db:seed
   ```
5. **Start development**: `npm run dev`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

The foundation is complete and ready for Task 2: "Implement core database models with multi-branch support". The database schema is already created, so Task 2 can focus on:

- Setting up Prisma client in the backend
- Creating database connection utilities
- Implementing basic CRUD operations
- Setting up authentication middleware
