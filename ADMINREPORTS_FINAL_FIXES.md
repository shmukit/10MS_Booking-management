# AdminReports Component - Final Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript useQuery Overload Error
**Problem**: The useQuery hooks were not properly handling the Axios response structure, causing TypeScript overload errors.

**Root Cause**: The API functions return Axios response objects with a `.data` property, but useQuery was expecting the raw data.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (causing errors):
queryFn: () => reportsAPI.getReports(filters),

// After (fixed):
queryFn: async () => {
  const response = await reportsAPI.getReports(filters)
  return response.data
},
```

### 2. Duplicate Utilization Report Section
**Problem**: There was a malformed duplicate utilization report section at the end of the file outside the main component.

**Fix Applied**: Removed the entire duplicate section that was causing JSX parsing errors.

### 3. Data Extraction Inconsistency
**Problem**: Some data extractions were trying to access `.data` property twice.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before:
const reports = reportData?.data || {}

// After:
const reports = reportData || {}
```
