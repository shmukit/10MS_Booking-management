# AdminReports Component Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Malformed Export Statement
**Problem**: Line 815 had a corrupted export statement: `export default AdminReportst */}`
**Fix**: Replaced with proper comment and JSX structure

### 2. Incorrect Indentation
**Problem**: Utilization report section had incorrect indentation causing JSX parsing errors
**Fix**: Fixed indentation to match React component structure

### 3. Duplicate Assessment Section
**Problem**: There was a duplicate assessment report section starting around line 867
**Fix**: Removed the entire duplicate section and fixed closing structure

### 4. Malformed JSX Comments
**Problem**: Comments were not properly formatted as JSX comments
**Fix**: Converted to proper JSX comment format `{/* comment */}`

### 5. Incorrect Closing Structure
**Problem**: Multiple closing braces and parentheses were malformed
**Fix**: Cleaned up the component closing structure
