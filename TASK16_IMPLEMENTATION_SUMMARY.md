# Task 16 Implementation Summary: Advanced Booking Features and Cross-Branch Edge Cases

## Overview

Successfully implemented advanced booking features and cross-branch edge cases as specified in task 16. This implementation enhances the booking system with sophisticated business rule handling, administrative controls, and cross-branch functionality.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Late Cancellation Handling with Slot Blocking ✅

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` endpoint with slot blocking logic
- Added `adminOverride` parameter for administrative bypasses
- Automatic slot blocking for cancellations within 24 hours
- System settings entries to track blocked slots (`blocked_slot_*` keys)

**Key Features:**
- Slots blocked due to late cancellation are not made available for rebooking
- Administrative override capability for emergency situations
- Proper audit logging of all override actions
- Blocked slot tracking with reason and timestamp

**Business Rules:**
- Students cannot cancel within 24 hours without admin override
- Late cancellations result in slot blocking to prevent revenue loss
- Admins can override blocking with proper justification and audit trail

### 2. Teacher Cancellation Workflow with Automatic Notifications ✅

**Implementation:**
- New `POST /api/bookings/teacher-cancel/:slotId` endpoint
- Automatic multi-channel notifications (SMS + in-app) to affected students
- Bulk booking cancellation for all students in the cancelled slot
- Integration with existing notification service

**Key Features:**
- Teachers and admins can cancel entire slots
- All confirmed bookings in the slot are automatically cancelled
- Immediate notifications sent to all affected students
- Configurable notification templates through system settings

**Workflow:**
1. Teacher/admin initiates slot cancellation with reason
2. System identifies all confirmed bookings for the slot
3. All bookings are cancelled with teacher cancellation reason
4. Notifications sent to all affected students via SMS and in-app
5. Priority rescheduling offered to affected students

### 3. Priority Rescheduling System for Affected Students ✅

**Implementation:**
- `GET /api/bookings/priority-slots/:studentId` endpoint for priority access
- `POST /api/bookings/priority-reschedule` endpoint for using priority access
- System settings entries to track priority rescheduling (`priority_reschedule_*` keys)
- Cross-branch priority rescheduling support

**Key Features:**
- Students affected by teacher cancellations get 7-day priority access
- Cross-branch rescheduling options when system settings allow
- Automatic cleanup of expired priority access
- Priority slots shown before general availability

**Priority System:**
- Granted automatically when teacher cancels a slot
- 7-day expiration period for priority access
- Cross-branch options based on system settings
- First-come-first-served within priority group

### 4. Administrative Override Capabilities with Audit Logging ✅

**Implementation:**
- `POST /api/bookings/admin-override` endpoint for various override actions
- Support for multiple override types: force booking, unblock slot, bypass monthly limit, emergency reschedule
- Comprehensive audit logging for all override actions
- Role-based access control (Super-Admin and Branch-Admin only)

**Override Actions:**
- **Force Booking:** Create booking despite business rule violations
- **Unblock Slot:** Remove slot blocking from late cancellations
- **Bypass Monthly Limit:** Grant temporary monthly booking limit bypass
- **Emergency Reschedule:** Reschedule without normal restrictions

**Audit Features:**
- All overrides logged with user, reason, and timestamp
- Detailed audit trail in system logs
- Override reason required for all actions
- Role-based access restrictions

### 5. Cross-Branch Booking Conflicts and Business Rule Enforcement ✅

**Implementation:**
- `GET /api/bookings/cross-branch-conflicts` endpoint for conflict detection
- Enhanced business rules with system settings integration
- Cross-branch booking validation based on system configuration
- Monthly booking limit enforcement across all branches

**Conflict Detection:**
- Monthly booking limits across all branches
- Same-day booking conflicts
- Cross-branch booking permission validation
- System-wide conflict statistics

**Business Rule Integration:**
- System settings control cross-branch booking permissions
- Monthly limits enforced globally across branches
- Configurable cancellation time limits
- Real-time conflict checking during booking creation

### 6. Blocked Slots Management System ✅

**Implementation:**
- `GET /api/bookings/blocked-slots` endpoint for viewing blocked slots
- Administrative interface for blocked slot management
- Automatic blocking for late cancellations
- Manual unblocking through administrative overrides

**Management Features:**
- View all blocked slots with details
- See blocking reason and responsible user
- Unblock slots through admin override system
- Track blocked slot history and patterns

## Enhanced Business Rules

### Updated Validation Functions

1. **`validateMonthlyLimit`** - Now supports bypass checking
2. **`validateCrossBranchBooking`** - Validates cross-branch permissions
3. **`validateSlotNotBlocked`** - Checks for blocked slots
4. **Enhanced cancellation validation** - Supports admin overrides

### System Settings Integration

- Cross-branch booking permissions
- Monthly booking limits
- Cancellation time restrictions
- Notification templates for all scenarios

## API Endpoints Added/Enhanced

### New Endpoints:
- `POST /api/bookings/teacher-cancel/:slotId` - Teacher cancellation workflow
- `GET /api/bookings/priority-slots/:studentId` - Priority rescheduling access
- `POST /api/bookings/priority-reschedule` - Use priority rescheduling
- `POST /api/bookings/admin-override` - Administrative overrides
- `GET /api/bookings/cross-branch-conflicts` - Conflict detection
- `GET /api/bookings/blocked-slots` - Blocked slots management

### Enhanced Endpoints:
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Added admin override support
- `POST /api/bookings` - Enhanced with cross-branch and blocking validation

## Database Schema Enhancements

### System Settings Usage:
- `blocked_slot_*` - Track blocked slots with metadata
- `priority_reschedule_*` - Track priority rescheduling access
- `monthly_bypass_*` - Track monthly limit bypasses
- `system_config` - Global system configuration

### Audit Logging:
- All administrative overrides logged
- Teacher cancellations tracked
- Priority rescheduling usage recorded
- Cross-branch booking attempts logged

## Testing and Verification

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Late cancellation handling and slot blocking
- ✅ Teacher cancellation workflow with notifications
