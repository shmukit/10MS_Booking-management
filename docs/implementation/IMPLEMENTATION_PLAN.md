## Implementation Tasks (No Phases - Vibe Coding Approach)

### Task 1: Role-Based Data Access Control (CRITICAL - 2-3 hours)
**Priority: URGENT** - This is the core issue blocking proper MVP functionality

#### 1.1 Backend API Role Filtering
- **Issue**: All APIs return same data regardless of user role
- **Impact**: Critical - security and UX issue
- **Solution**:
  - Update `bookingsAPI.getMyBookings()` to filter by role:
    - Super Admin: All bookings across all branches
    - Branch Admin: Bookings in their branch only
    - Teacher: Bookings for their sessions only
    - Student: Their own bookings only
  - Update `assessmentsAPI.getMyAssessments()` with same role filtering
  - Update `slotsAPI.getAvailable()` with role-based filtering
  - Add role-based middleware to all API endpoints

#### 1.2 Frontend Role-Based Content Rendering
- **Issue**: All user types see identical UI components
- **Impact**: High - confusing user experience
- **Solution**:
  - **Schedule Page**: Different content per role
    - Super Admin: All slots + management actions
    - Branch Admin: Branch slots + management actions
    - Teacher: Their assigned slots only
    - Student: Available slots for booking only
  - **Bookings Page**: Different content per role
    - Super Admin: All bookings + management actions
    - Branch Admin: Branch bookings + management actions
    - Teacher: Their session bookings + assessment actions
    - Student: Their own bookings + booking actions
  - **Assessments Page**: Different content per role
    - Super Admin: All assessments + management actions
    - Branch Admin: Branch assessments + management actions
    - Teacher: Their recorded assessments + pending to record
    - Student: Their own assessment results only

### Task 2: Database Connection Fix (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)
**Priority: URGENT** - System currently using mock data

#### 2.1 Supabase Connection
- **Issue**: Database connection failing, system using mock data
- **Impact**: Critical - blocks all real functionality
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify Supabase connection settings in `.env`
  - Test database connectivity
  - Update Prisma configuration if needed
  - Run database migrations

### Task 3: Mobile Responsiveness Enhancement (HIGH - 2-3 hours)
**Priority: HIGH** - Affects user experience significantly

- **Issue**: Dashboard shows same metrics for all user types
- **Impact**: Medium - affects admin decision making
- **Solution**:
  - **Super Admin**: System-wide metrics, branch comparison, user analytics
  - **Branch Admin**: Branch-specific metrics, teacher performance, utilization
  - **Teacher**: Personal schedule, student performance, assessment stats
  - **Student**: Personal bookings, score history, upcoming tests

### Task 5: Waiting List System (LOW - 1-2 hours)
