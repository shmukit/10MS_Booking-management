## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript useQuery Overload Error
**Problem**: The useQuery hooks were not properly handling the Axios response structure, causing TypeScript overload errors.

**Root Cause**: The API functions return Axios response objects with a `.data` property, but useQuery was expecting the raw data.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (causing errors):
queryFn: () => reportsAPI.getReports(filters),

// After (fixed):
queryFn: async () => {
  const response = await reportsAPI.getReports(filters)
  return response.data
},
```

### Malformed Export Statement and JSX Structure
**Problem**: 
- Line 815 had a corrupted export statement: `export default AdminReportst */}`
- Incorrect indentation causing JSX parsing errors
- Duplicate assessment report sections
- Malformed JSX comments

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced with proper comment and JSX structure
- Fixed indentation to match React component structure
- Removed duplicate sections
- Converted to proper JSX comment format `{/* comment */}`
- Cleaned up component closing structure

### Data Extraction Inconsistency
**Problem**: Some data extractions were trying to access `.data` property twice.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before:
const reports = reportData?.data || {}

// After:
const reports = reportData || {}
```
