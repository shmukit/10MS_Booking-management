## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
- **Routes**: `src/routes/bookings.ts`
- **Database**: Booking model with status tracking
- **Validation**: Business rule validation middleware
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

### Frontend Components
- **Booking Form**: Multi-step booking interface
- **Booking Management**: Admin booking management interface
- **Calendar View**: Visual slot availability display

## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript Parameter Type Errors
**Problem**: All route handlers had implicit `any` types for `req` and `res` parameters (16 TypeScript errors)

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit type imports: `import { Request, Response } from 'express'`
- Added explicit types to all async handler functions: `async (req: Request, res: Response) => {`

### Query Parameter Type Issues
**Problem**: TypeScript couldn't infer correct types for query parameters when creating Date objects

**Solution**:
- Added explicit type assertions: `filters.startDate as string`
- Applied to all date parameter usages in the route

### Import and Code Quality Issues
**Problem**: 
- Unused `z` import from zod causing warning
- Express import structure causing compatibility issues
- Unused variable warnings

**Solution**:
- Removed unused imports
- Fixed express import structure
- Cleaned up unused variables
