## Technical Implementation

- **Database**: Assessment model with IELTS scoring fields
- **Validation**: Score validation middleware
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions

### Frontend Components
- **Assessment Form**: IELTS score input interface
- **Rubrics Display**: Tabbed interface for IELTS criteria

## Issues Fixed

### TypeScript Type Assertion Errors
**Problem**: API responses were typed as `unknown`, causing TypeScript errors when accessing properties.

**Solution**: Added proper type assertions for API responses:
```typescript
// Before
const rubricsResponse = await axios.get(...);
console.log(rubricsResponse.data.criteria.length); // Error: 'unknown' type

// After  
const rubricsResponse = await axios.get(...);
const rubrics = rubricsResponse.data as any;
console.log(rubrics.criteria.length); // Fixed
```

### Duplicate Link Imports
**Problem**: The Schedule.tsx file had multiple duplicate `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'` statements causing Vite build errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed 7 duplicate Link import statements
- Fixed type import to use `import type` for better TypeScript compatibility
- Consolidated to single clean import: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'`

### Additional Fixes Applied
1. **Backend Verification Script** - All TypeScript errors resolved
2. **Frontend Type System** - Enum syntax converted to const objects for compatibility
3. **Missing UI Components** - Created Badge component for Layout
4. **Frontend Verification** - Unused variable warnings eliminated
