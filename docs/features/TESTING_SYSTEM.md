# Comprehensive Testing System Documentation

## Overview
Comprehensive integration testing suite for the multi-branch speaking test booking system. The test suite validates all core functionality including cross-branch features, audit trails, mobile responsiveness, and data isolation.

## Test Infrastructure

### TestDataManager Class (`backend/src/tests/setup.ts`)
- **Centralized Data Management**: Single source for test data creation and cleanup
- **Multi-Branch Test Data**: Creates 3 branches (Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet)
- **Role-Based Users**: Super Admin, Branch Admins, Teachers, Students across branches
- **Test Utilities**: Helper functions for formatting results and managing delays
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ensures clean state between test runs

### Test Architecture
- **Modular Test Suites**: Separate files for different functionality areas
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all major system components
- **Cross-Branch Validation**: Ensures proper multi-branch functionality
- **Role-Based Testing**: Validates access control and permissions
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Tests all business logic and constraints
