# Task 10 Final Status Report

## âœ… Issue Resolution Summary

### **Primary Issue Fixed: Duplicate Link Imports**
**Problem**: The Schedule.tsx file had multiple duplicate `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'` statements causing Vite build errors.

**Solution**: 
- Removed 7 duplicate Link import statements
- Fixed type import to use `import type` for better TypeScript compatibility
- Consolidated to single clean import: `import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'`

### **Additional Fixes Applied**:
1. **Backend Verification Script** - All TypeScript errors resolved
2. **Frontend Type System** - Enum syntax converted to const objects for compatibility
