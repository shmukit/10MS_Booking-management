tsx src/tests/run-individual-tests.ts notifications
tsx src/tests/run-individual-tests.ts audit
tsx src/tests/run-individual-tests.ts mobile
```

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL database running (Docker Compose recommended)
2. **Environment Variables**: Proper `.env` configuration
3. **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed
4. **Database Schema**: Prisma schema applied (`npm run db:push`)

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/speaking_test_booking"
TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/speaking_test_booking_test" # Optional
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
SMS_API_KEY="your-sms-api-key" # For SMS testing
```

### Test Data
The test suite automatically:
- Creates test branches (Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet)
- Creates users for all roles across branches
- Creates test slots and bookings
- Cleans up all test data after completion

## Test Architecture

### Test Data Manager (`setup.ts`)
- **Centralized Data Management**: Single source for test data creation
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ensures clean state between test runs
- **Role-Based Data**: Creates users for all system roles
- **Cross-Branch Data**: Sets up multi-branch test scenarios

### Test Utilities
- **formatTestResult()**: Consistent test result formatting
- **delay()**: Simulate async operations and processing time
- **TestDataManager**: Manages test data lifecycle

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Failures**: Tests continue even if individual assertions fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Clear error messages and debugging information
- **Cleanup on Exit**: Ensures test data is cleaned up even on failures

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Indicators
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: Test assertion succeeded
- üìä **Metrics**: Performance and coverage statistics
- üéâ **All Tests Passed**: Ready for deployment

### Failure Indicators
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: Test assertion failed with details
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings**: Non-critical issues that should be reviewed
- üõë **Critical Failures**: Issues that block deployment

### Report Sections
1. **Overall Results**: Success rate and timing
2. **Detailed Results**: Individual test suite outcomes
3. **Test Coverage Summary**: What functionality was validated
4. **Next Steps**: Recommendations for addressing failures

## Best Practices

### Running Tests
1. **Clean Environment**: Start with a clean database state
2. **Isolated Runs**: Run tests in isolation to avoid interference
3. **Regular Execution**: Run tests after any significant changes
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Include in automated deployment pipelines

### Debugging Failed Tests
1. **Individual Suites**: Run specific test suites to isolate issues
2. **Verbose Logging**: Enable detailed logging for debugging
3. **Manual Verification**: Manually test failed scenarios
4. **Database State**: Check database state after failures

### Maintenance
1. **Update Test Data**: Keep test scenarios current with requirements
2. **Add New Tests**: Include tests for new features
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution time
4. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation updated

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing on mobile devices completed
- [ ] SMS delivery tested in staging environment
- [ ] Cross-branch scenarios validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security boundaries verified

### Continuous Integration
The test suite is designed to be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
- Automated test execution on code changes
- Test result reporting and notifications
- Deployment blocking on test failures
- Performance regression detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
2. **Environment Variables**: Verify all required environment variables are set
3. **Port Conflicts**: Check that required ports are available
4. **SMS Service**: Mock SMS service for testing environments

### Performance Considerations
- Tests create and clean up significant amounts of data
- Database operations may be slow on first run
- Network timeouts may occur with external services
- Consider using test database for isolation

### Security Notes
- Test data includes sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- Ensure test databases are properly secured
- Clean up test data in production environments
- Use mock services for external integrations in testing
