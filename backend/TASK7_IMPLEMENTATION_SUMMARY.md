# Task 7: Multi-Channel Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-channel notification system (SMS + In-App) with automated reminders, delivery tracking, and admin management capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Notification Service (`src/services/notification.ts`)
- **Multi-channel delivery**: SMS and in-app notifications
- **Template system**: Configurable templates for all notification types
- **SMS delivery tracking**: Status monitoring and history
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when SMS fails
- **Admin management**: Template updates and notification statistics

#### Key Features:
- Notification templates for: BOOKING_CONFIRMED, BOOKING_REMINDER, BOOKING_CANCELLED, SYSTEM_ALERT
- SMS delivery status tracking with cleanup
- Template placeholder replacement system
- Role-based notification sending
- Comprehensive statistics and monitoring

### 2. Automated Scheduler Service (`src/services/scheduler.ts`)
- **24-hour reminders**: Cron job runs hourly to send booking reminders
- **Daily cleanup**: Removes old notifications and SMS logs
- **Manual triggers**: Admin can manually trigger reminders and cleanup
- **Integration**: Immediate notifications for booking events

#### Cron Jobs:
- **Reminder Job**: Runs every hour (`0 * * * *`) to check for bookings needing 24-hour reminders
- **Cleanup Job**: Runs daily at 2 AM (`0 2 * * *`) to clean old data and update booking statuses

### 3. Notification API Routes (`src/routes/notifications.ts`)
Comprehensive REST API with role-based access control:

#### User Endpoints:
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications with filtering
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread notification count
- `GET /api/notifications/:id` - Get single notification
- `PUT /api/notifications/mark-read` - Mark multiple notifications as read
- `PUT /api/notifications/:id/read` - Mark single notification as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/:id` - Delete notification

#### Admin Endpoints:
- `POST /api/notifications/send` - Send notification to users (Admin)
- `GET /api/notifications/admin/templates` - Get notification templates (Admin)
- `PUT /api/notifications/admin/templates` - Update notification template (Super Admin)
- `GET /api/notifications/admin/stats` - Get notification statistics (Admin)
- `GET /api/notifications/sms-status/:messageId` - Get SMS delivery status
- `POST /api/notifications/sms-webhook` - SMS delivery webhook

### 4. Integration with Booking System
- **Booking creation**: Automatic confirmation notifications (SMS + In-App)
- **Booking cancellation**: Automatic cancellation notifications (SMS + In-App)
- **Teacher cancellations**: Notifications to all affected students
- **Rescheduling**: Appropriate notifications for booking changes

### 5. Database Integration
- **Notification model**: Stores in-app notifications with read/unread status
- **User relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization for notification queries
- **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old read notifications (90 days)

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "node-cron": "^3.0.3",
  "@types/node-cron": "^3.0.11"
}
```
