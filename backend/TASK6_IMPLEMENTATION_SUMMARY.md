## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Utilization
- **Booking Model**: Full utilization of status, attended, cancellation tracking
- **Slot Model**: Capacity management and cross-branch relationships
- **User Model**: Role-based access control integration
- **Branch Model**: Cross-branch functionality support

### Validation Schemas
```typescript
- createBookingSchema: Slot ID and optional student phone
- updateBookingSchema: Status, attendance, cancellation reason
- rescheduleBookingSchema: New slot ID validation
- bookingFiltersSchema: Comprehensive filtering options
```

### Helper Functions
```typescript
- isCancellationWithin24Hours(): 24-hour policy enforcement
- checkMonthlyDuplicateBooking(): Cross-branch duplicate prevention
- getAvailableSlots(): Cross-branch slot availability
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Students**: Can book, cancel, reschedule own bookings (with restrictions)
- **Teachers**: Can manage bookings for their slots, mark attendance
- **Branch Admins**: Can manage bookings within their branch
- **Super Admins**: Full access across all branches
