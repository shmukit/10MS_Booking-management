# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Cross-Branch Slot Management System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive cross-branch slot management system with full CRUD operations, business rule validation, and role-based access control.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Slot Creation and Management Endpoints

#### **POST /api/slots** - Create Single Slot
- ✅ Validates all input data (branch, teacher, date, time, capacity)
- ✅ Enforces business rules (time validation, capacity limits)
- ✅ Checks for teacher availability conflicts
- ✅ Verifies teacher belongs to specified branch
- ✅ Prevents creation of slots in the past
- ✅ Role-based access control (Admin only)
- ✅ Audit logging for all operations

#### **POST /api/slots/bulk** - Bulk Slot Creation
- ✅ Creates multiple slots in a single operation (up to 50)
- ✅ Validates all slots before creating any
- ✅ Comprehensive conflict checking across all slots
- ✅ Atomic operation with detailed error reporting
- ✅ Performance optimized with caching

#### **PUT /api/slots/:id** - Update Slot
- ✅ Supports partial updates
- ✅ Prevents modification of slots with confirmed bookings
- ✅ Allows capacity increases even with bookings
- ✅ Re-validates conflicts after updates
- ✅ Captures old values for audit trail

#### **DELETE /api/slots/:id** - Delete Slot
- ✅ Prevents deletion of slots with confirmed bookings
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Complete audit trail

### 2. Slot Availability Calculation and Capacity Management

#### **GET /api/slots** - List Slots with Availability
- ✅ Real-time availability calculation
- ✅ Shows capacity, booked count, and available spots
- ✅ Filters by availability status
- ✅ Cross-branch querying with proper access control

#### **GET /api/slots/:id** - Get Single Slot with Details
- ✅ Detailed availability information
- ✅ Booking details for administrators
- ✅ Branch and teacher information
- ✅ Role-based data filtering

### 3. Slot Filtering and Querying Logic

#### **Daily, Weekly, Monthly Views**
- ✅ Dynamic date range calculation
- ✅ Flexible view switching (daily/weekly/monthly)
- ✅ Custom date range support
- ✅ Proper week boundary handling (Sunday to Saturday)

#### **Advanced Filtering Options**
- ✅ Filter by branch ID
- ✅ Filter by teacher ID
- ✅ Filter by specific date or date range
- ✅ Filter by availability status
- ✅ Combined filter support

### 4. Business Rules and Validation

#### **Time Slot Validation**
- ✅ Minimum duration: 15 minutes
- ✅ Maximum duration: 3 hours
- ✅ End time must be after start time
- ✅ Proper time format validation (HH:MM)

#### **Conflict Detection**
- ✅ Teacher availability checking
- ✅ Overlapping slot detection
- ✅ Multiple conflict scenarios handled
- ✅ Detailed conflict reporting

#### **Capacity Management**
- ✅ Capacity limits (1-10 students per slot)
- ✅ Real-time availability calculation
- ✅ Booking count tracking
- ✅ Prevents overbooking

### 5. Cross-Branch Constraints and Access Control

#### **Role-Based Access**
- ✅ **Super Admin**: Full access to all branches
- ✅ **Branch Admin**: Access only to own branch slots
- ✅ **Teacher**: View only own slots
- ✅ **Student**: Read-only access (via other endpoints)

#### **Branch Validation**
- ✅ Verifies branch exists and is active
- ✅ Ensures teacher belongs to specified branch
- ✅ Prevents cross-branch unauthorized operations
- ✅ Automatic branch filtering based on user role

### 6. Branch Listing Endpoints

#### **Integration with Existing Branch System**
- ✅ Leverages existing `/api/branches` endpoints
- ✅ Branch information included in slot responses
- ✅ Active branch validation
- ✅ Branch-specific slot filtering

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Database Schema Integration**
- ✅ Uses existing Prisma schema with Slot model
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships (Branch, Teacher)
- ✅ Optimized database indexes for performance
- ✅ Booking relationship for availability calculation

### **Validation and Error Handling**
- ✅ Zod schema validation for all inputs
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Detailed validation error reporting

### **Security and Audit**
- ✅ JWT-based authentication
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ✅ Complete audit logging
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation

### **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper includes
- ✅ Indexed queries for date and branch filtering
- ✅ Bulk operations for multiple slot creation
- ✅ Caching for teacher/branch validation
